  abstract  = "Sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation are key indicators of the demographic diversity in the United States. Sex and gender are often conflated under the assumptions that they are mutually determined and do not differ from each other; however, the growing visibility of transgender and intersex populations, as well as efforts to improve the measurement of sex and gender across many scientific fields, has demonstrated the need to reconsider how sex, gender, and the relationship between them are conceptualized. This is turn affects sexual orientation, because it is defined on the basis of the relationship between a person's own sex or gender and that of their actual or preferred partners. Sex, gender, and sexual orientation are core aspects of identity that shape opportunities, experiences with discrimination, and outcomes through the life course; therefore, it is crucial that measures of these concepts accurately capture their complexity.\nRecognition of the diversity within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and other sexual and gender minorities - the LGBTQI+ population - has also led to a reexamination of how the concepts of sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation are measured. Better measurement will improve the ability to identify sexual and gender minority populations and understand the challenges they face. LGBTQI+ people continue to experience disparate and inequitable treatment, including harassment, discrimination, and violence, which in turn affects outcomes in many areas of everyday life, including health and access to health care services, economic and educational attainment, and family and social support. Though knowledge of these disparities has increased significantly over the past decade, glaring gaps remain, often driven by a lack of reliable data.\nMeasuring Sex, Gender Identity, and Sexual Orientation recommends that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) adopt new practices for collecting data on sex, gender, and sexual orientation  -  including collecting gender data by default, and not conflating gender with sex as a biological variable.  The report recommends standardized language to be used in survey questions that ask about a respondent's sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation.  Better measurements will improve data quality, as well as the NIH's ability to identify LGBTQI+ populations and understand the challenges they face.",

	abstract = {The biopsychosocial etiology of gender dysphoria is poorly understood, but current thought suggests a complex interaction of genetic, hormonal, environmental, and differences in brain development and physiology. Twin studies have implicated a genetic role in the formation of gender identity. Congruence for gender dysphoria is more common among monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins. We present a case of monozygotic (identical) triplets who have each transitioned from female to male under the care of a university transgender health service. Each triplet experienced gender dysphoria from childhood and has undergone transitional endocrine care and various aspects of gender-affirming surgery. Although a pure genetic or biological component cannot be attributed as a cause of their gender dysphoria with absolute certainty since the triplets were raised together, this unusual case of gender dysphoria among a set of monozygotic triplets adds support for a heritable role in gender identity formation.},

	abstract = {Gender constancy judgments in children referredfor problems in their gender identity development (N =206) and controls (N = 95) were compared. On Slaby andFrey's (1975) gender constancy interview, the gender-referred children performed more poorlythan the controls at three stage levels: genderidentity, gender stability, and gender consistency. Onthe Boy-Girl Identity Task, a second measure of gender constancy (Emmerich et al., 1977), thegender-referred children also performed more poorly.Gender-referred children who had not attained genderconsistency engaged in significantly less same-sex-typed play on a free-play task than thegender-referred children who had, but there were nogender consistency effects for the controls. Two othermeasures of sex-typed behavior were unrelated to genderconsistency. In the gender-referred group alone, childrenwho “failed” the gender identity or genderstability stages were more likely to draw anopposite-sex person first on the Draw-a-Person test andto evince more affective gender confusion on the GenderIdentity Interview (Zucker et al., 1993) than childrenwho had “passed.” It is concluded thatchildren referred for problems in their gender identitydevelopment have a developmental lag in gender constancyacquisition. Possible reasons for the lag arediscussed.},

From time to time in scientific literature there are descriptions of a diagnosis of psychotic disorders in persons previously diagnosed and treated as transsexuals, in whom the transsexual thinking disappears after using antipsychotic agents. Coexistence of transsexualism and schizophrenia causes a lot of doubt--it is observed in scientists opinions but also in the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV and ICD-10. Moreover, delusions of sex change are probably more frequent than it is thought. It causes, that in some cases the differential diagnosis of psychosis and gender identity disorders may be very difficult. Transsexuals treatment is on one hand connected with expected effects but on the other hand with many serious, often irreversible health consequences (e.g. cardiovascular disease, risk of neoplasma development, infertility, consequences of surgical sex reassignment). That is why the differential diagnosis of transsexualism and schizophrenia should be made carefully and thoughtfully.},

	abstract = {Background. We prospectively studied outcomes of sex reassignment, potential differences between subgroups of transsexuals, and predictors of treatment course and outcome.Method. Altogether 325 consecutive adolescent and adult applicants for sex reassignment participated: 222 started hormone treatment, 103 did not; 188 completed and 34 dropped out of treatment. Only data of the 162 adults were used to evaluate treatment. Results between subgroups were compared to determine post-operative differences. Adults and adolescents were included to study predictors of treatment course and outcome. Results were statistically analysed with logistic regression and multiple linear regression analyses.Results. After treatment the group was no longer gender dysphoric. The vast majority functioned quite well psychologically, socially and sexually. Two non-homosexual male-to-female transsexuals expressed regrets. Post-operatively, female-to-male and homosexual transsexuals functioned better in many respects than male-to-female and non-homosexual transsexuals. Eligibility for treatment was largely based upon gender dysphoria, psychological stability, and physical appearance. Male-to-female transsexuals with more psychopathology and cross-gender symptoms in childhood, yet less gender dysphoria at application, were more likely to drop out prematurely. Non-homosexual applicants with much psychopathology and body dissatisfaction reported the worst post-operative outcomes.Conclusions. The results substantiate previous conclusions that sex reassignment is effective. Still, clinicians need to be alert for non-homosexual male-to-females with unfavourable psychological functioning and physical appearance and inconsistent gender dysphoria reports, as these are risk factors for dropping out and poor post-operative results. If they are considered eligible, they may require additional therapeutic guidance during or even after treatment.},

The earliest reports of gender identity alteration can be traced back to 1500 BC in ancient Egypt and during the Roman Empire (509 to 27 BC). During the modern era, Magnus Hirschfeld was considered the father of transgender healthcare and established the Institute for Sexual Science in Berlin. This was the world’s first institute devoted to sexology and was the site of the first documented gender affirmation surgery: orchiectomy, penectomy, and vaginoplasty in a transgender female patient. Dr. Harry Benjamin was a close friend of Hirschfeld who also had a keen interest in transgender healthcare and advocacy. Dr. Benjamin assisted hundreds of transgender individuals by prescribing hormones and suggested they visit surgeons abroad for gender affirmation surgeries. He later founded the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA), which outlined standards of care for transgender individuals who desired medical and surgical treatment. In 2007, HBIGDA became known as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which is a professional organization dedicated to the care and treatment of individuals with gender dysphoria today.},

The management of such disorders is complex, and one of the most crucial decision is represented by gender assignment. In fact, the primary goal in DSD is to have a gender assignment consistent with the underlying gender identity in order to prevent the distress related to a forthcoming Gender Dysphoria. Historically, gender assignment was based essentially on surgical outcomes, assuming the neutrality of gender identity at birth. This policy has been challenged in the past decade refocusing on the importance of prenatal and postnatal hormonal and genetic influences on psychosexual development.},

	abstract = {Bioelectrical impedance analysis is an extremely popular method for assessment of body composition. Despite its wide-spread use over the past thirty years, its accuracy and clinical value is still questioned. Most frequently, criticisms focus on its purported poor absolute accuracy and that different impedance analysers or prediction equations fail to measure body composition identically. This perspective review highlights that the magnitude of errors associated with impedance methods are not dissimilar to those observed for so-called gold standard methods. It is argued that the focus on statistically significant but small differences between methods can obscure operational equivalence and that such differences may be of minor clinical significance. Finally, the need for better standardization of protocols and the need for consensus on what is a minimal clinically important difference between methods is highlighted.},

	abstract = {Measurement of phase angle using bioimpedance analysis (BIA) has become popular as an index of so-called “cellular health”. What precisely is meant by this term is not always clear but strong relationships have been found between cellular water status (the relative amounts of extra- and intracellular water), cell membrane integrity and cellular mass. Much of the current research is empirical observation and frequently pays little regard to the underlying biophysical models that underpin the BIA technique or attempts to provide mechanistic explanations for the observations. This brief review seeks to provide a basic understanding of the electrical models frequently used to describe the passive electrical properties of tissues with particular focus on phase angle. In addition, it draws attention to some practical concerns in the measurement of phase angle and notes the additional understanding that can be gained when phase angle are obtained with bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) rather than single frequency BIA (SFBIA) along with the potential for simulation modelling.},

Although bioimpedance techniques have been used for more than 100 years to monitor assorted biological components, the desire to translate bioelectrical measurements into physiological variables advanced the creation of empirical prediction models that produced inconsistent results.},

	abstract = {Individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) are at a higher risk for suicidality compared to the general population. A growing body of research has investigated this risk, particularly with attention to systemic factors such as discrimination and harassment. Unfortunately, research has only examined the impact of direct discrimination on suicidality and has neglected to examine how ambient discrimination (i.e., witnessing or being made aware of discriminatory behaviors directed at someone other than yourself in your group) relates to suicidality. Additionally, although some links exist between discrimination and suicidality, the mechanisms by which these are related are understudied. This study aimed to address these gaps by exploring the effect of ambient discrimination on suicidal ideation and examining psychological pain as a mediator in this relationship. Data were collected from a sample of 200 LGBTQ-identified individuals (M age = 35 years; 53.5\% female; 86\% White). Results of independent t tests and a one-way multivariate ANOVA revealed greater vulnerability for ambient/direct discrimination and psychache among individuals identifying as transgender, queer, and other. Regression and mediation analyses revealed that while both ambient and direct discrimination predicted suicidal ideation, only direct discrimination accounted for unique variance in the outcome; however, both ambient and direct discrimination contributed unique variance to psychological pain, which fully mediated their relationships to suicidal ideation. Results of this study may begin to provide insight into the pathways of risk and points of intervention for suicidality in the LGBTQ community.},

	abstract = {The alteration of sex-specific body features and the establishment of a satisfactory body image are known to be particularly relevant for individuals with Gender Dysphoria (GD). The aim of the study was to first develop new scales and examine the psychometric properties of the Hamburg Body Drawing Scale (Appelt \& Strauß 1988). For the second part of this study, the satisfaction with different body features in young GD adults before cross-sex treatment were compared to female and male controls. Data collection took place within the context of the European Network for the Investigation of Gender Incongruence (ENIGI) including 135 female-to-male (FtMs) and 115 male-to-female (MtFs) young GD adults and 235 female and 379 male age-adjusted controls. The five female and six male body feature subscales revealed good internal consistency. The ENIGI sample reported less satisfaction with overall appearance (d = 0.30) and with all of their body features than controls, but no subgroup differences for sexual orientation (FtM and MtF) and Age of Onset (FtM) were found. Body dissatisfaction was higher with regard to sex-specific body features (largest effect sizes of d = 3.21 for Genitalia in FtMs and d = 2.85 for Androgen-responsive features and genitalia in MtFs) than with those that appeared less related to the natal sex (d = 0.64 for Facial features in FtMs and d = 0.59 for Body shape in MtFs). Not only medical body modifying interventions, but also psychosocial guidance with regard to body image might be helpful for GD individuals before transitioning.},

Pairs of reviewers selected and appraised the studies. A random-effects model was used to pool weighted mean differences and 95\\% confidence intervals (CIs).We found 29 eligible studies with moderate risk of bias. In female-to-male (FTM) individuals, sex steroid therapy was associated with statistically significant increases in serum triglyceride (TG) levels at 3 to 6 months and at ≥24 months (21.4 mg/dL; 95\\% CI: 0.14 to 42.6) and in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels at 12 months and ≥24 months (17.8 mg/dL; 95\\% CI: 3.5 to 32.1). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels decreased significantly across all follow-up periods (highest at ≥24 months, −8.5 mg/dL; 95\\% CI: −13.0 to −3.9). In male-to-female (MTF) individuals, serum TG levels were significantly higher at ≥24 months (31.9 mg/dL; 95\\% CI: 3.9 to 59.9) without any changes in other parameters. Few myocardial infarction, stroke, VTE, and death events were reported (more frequently in MTF individuals).Low-quality evidence suggests that sex steroid therapy may increase LDL-C and TG levels and decrease HDL-C level in FTM individuals, whereas oral estrogens may increase TG levels in MTF individuals. Data about important patient outcomes remain sparse.}",

	abstract = {Hormonally controlled differences in bone mineral density (BMD) between males and females are well studied. The effects of cross-sex hormones on bone metabolism in patients with early onset gender identity disorder (EO-GID), however, are unclear. We examined BMD, total body fat (TBF) and total lean body mass (TLBM) in patients prior to initiation of sex hormone treatment and during treatment at months 3 and 12. The study included 33 EO-GID patients who were approved for sex reassignment and a control group of 122 healthy Norwegians (males, n=77; females, n=45). Male patients (n=12) received an oral dose of 50 μg ethinylestradiol daily for the first 3 months and 100 μg daily thereafter. Female patients (n=21) received 250 mg testosterone enantate intramuscularly every third week. BMD, TBF and TLBM were estimated using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In male patients, the DXA measurements except TBF were significantly lower compared to their same-sex control group at baseline and did not change during treatment. In female patients, the DXA measurements were slightly higher than in same-sex controls at baseline and also remained unchanged during treatment. In conclusion, this study reports that body composition and bone density of EO-GID patients show less pronounced sex differences compared to controls and that bone density was unaffected by cross-sex hormone treatment.},

Cross-sex hormonal treatment (CHT) alleviates the dissatisfaction by making various changes in the body. We examined the alteration of body uneasiness, eating attitudes and behaviors, and psychological symptoms longitudinally in Turkish participants with female-to-male gender dysphoria (FtM GD) after CHT. Thirty-seven participants with FtM GD and 40 female controls were asked to complete the Body Uneasiness Test to explore different areas of body-related psychopathology, the Eating Attitudes Test to assess eating disturbances, and the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised to measure psychological state, both before CHT and after 6 months of CHT administration. The baseline mean body weight, BMI scores, body uneasiness scores, and general psychopathological symptoms of participants with FtM GD were significantly higher than female controls, whereas baseline eating attitudes and behaviors were not significantly different. Over time, FtM GD participants’ mean body weight and BMI scores increased, body uneasiness and general psychopathological symptoms decreased, and eating attitudes and behaviors had not changed at 24th weeks following CHT administration compared to baseline. CHT may have a positive impact on body uneasiness and general psychopathological symptoms in participants with FtM GD. However, CHT does not have an impact on eating attitudes and behaviors.},

A total of 88 self-identified male-to-female transsexuals (MtF), 43 female-to-male transsexuals (FtM), 62 females with an eating disorder, 56 male controls, and 116 female controls completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, Eating Disorder Inventory, Body Checking Questionnaire, Drive for Muscularity Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. MtF showed higher scores on restrained eating, eating concerns, weight concerns, shape concerns, drive for thinness, bulimia, body dissatisfaction, and body checking compared to male controls, and concerning some variables also compared to female controls. FtM displayed a higher degree of restrained eating, weight concerns, shape concerns, body dissatisfaction, and body checking compared to male controls. Furthermore, participants with GID showed higher depression scores than did controls, whereas no differences concerning drive for muscularity and self-esteem were found. Between MtF and FtM, the only significant difference emerged for body checking, with MtF displaying higher scores. Although it was shown that on these variables the values for persons with GID were lower than for those with eating disorders, these data lead us to speculate that persons with GID might be at a higher risk of eating disturbances. Therefore, the implementation of prevention programs might help persons with GID to avoid developing a clinically relevant eating disorder.},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We included 65 people assessed for eating disorders, 40 patients and 25 healthy controls, who were given two tests: the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF) to investigate the presence of traumatic events and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) to assess the emotional regulation.
RESULTS: People with eating disorders showed higher average scores, and therefore greater severity than the control group, in all the domains explored, both considering traumatic experiences and emotional dysregulation. The domain emotional neglect showed the closest correlation with eating disorders (average scoring 15.9 vs 9.9 of healthy controls), followed by emotional abuse (12.2 vs 7.8), physical neglect (8.2 vs 6.6), physical abuse (8.3 vs 6.6) and sexual abuse (7.2 vs 5.6). In the same way, the emotional dysregulation was greater among people with eating disorder than healty controls, concerning every items explored by DERS, as clarity (average scoring 14.8 vs 11.4), awareness (17.1 vs 11.7), goals (16.3 vs 12.9), strategy (22.0 vs 14.7), non acceptance (17.4 vs 12.1) and impulse (16.5 vs 11.4).
CONCLUSIONS: Childhood traumatic experiences and emotional dysregulation result significantly higher in people with eating disorders than healthy controls.},

There has also been no evaluation of whether deficits in interoception play a causal role in the development of disordered eating. Nor has there been a review of the moderating/mediating factors of the relationship between interoception and disordered eating. To address these gaps we conducted a systematic review using PRISMA guidelines. 104 studies with 32883 participants were included. Deficits in interoception were observed across disordered eating types and interoceptive modalities suggesting that interoception may constitute a transdiagnostic feature of disordered eating. There is currently limited evidence on the causal role of interoception in the development of disordered eating and no studies have formally analysed the moderators/mediators. Future mechanistic research examining particular dimensions of interoception will provide insights into the specific interoceptive deficits associated with disordered eating and could lead to the development of improved therapies.},

Although there are many factors that predispose individuals to weight gain and obesity, the current review focuses on two ways eating behavior may be influenced by sensitivity to interoceptive signals of hunger, satiety, and metabolic energy reserves. First, obesity may be related to hypersensitivity to interoceptive signals of hunger, leading to positive alliesthesia for food cues that undermine attempts to change unhealthy eating behaviors. Second, overeating and obesity may arise from an inability to accurately detect interoceptive signals of satiety and positive energy balance. The findings reviewed herein demonstrate that obesity may be related to altered interoception, and warrant the continued development of novel obesity interventions aimed at promoting interoceptive awareness.},

In total, 485 individuals diagnosed with GD from four European countries, applying for medical treatment, filled out the Body Image Scale for Transsexuals. A six-factor model reflecting different body areas was confirmed via confirmatory factor analysis. A further configuration of body satisfaction was modelled using correlation network analysis techniques in R. Genital dissatisfaction showed limited connection with other body areas in comparison to other subscales. Body characteristics influencing social gender recognition were most centrally involved in body (dis)satisfaction in both natal sexes. In trans women these characteristics were related mostly to voice and hair, whereas in trans men these characteristics were related to muscularity and posture. Focusing on these socially influential body characteristics may provide important targets for transgender healthcare.},
