  abstract  = "Sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation are key indicators of the demographic diversity in the United States. Sex and gender are often conflated under the assumptions that they are mutually determined and do not differ from each other; however, the growing visibility of transgender and intersex populations, as well as efforts to improve the measurement of sex and gender across many scientific fields, has demonstrated the need to reconsider how sex, gender, and the relationship between them are conceptualized. This is turn affects sexual orientation, because it is defined on the basis of the relationship between a person's own sex or gender and that of their actual or preferred partners. Sex, gender, and sexual orientation are core aspects of identity that shape opportunities, experiences with discrimination, and outcomes through the life course; therefore, it is crucial that measures of these concepts accurately capture their complexity.\nRecognition of the diversity within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and other sexual and gender minorities - the LGBTQI+ population - has also led to a reexamination of how the concepts of sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation are measured. Better measurement will improve the ability to identify sexual and gender minority populations and understand the challenges they face. LGBTQI+ people continue to experience disparate and inequitable treatment, including harassment, discrimination, and violence, which in turn affects outcomes in many areas of everyday life, including health and access to health care services, economic and educational attainment, and family and social support. Though knowledge of these disparities has increased significantly over the past decade, glaring gaps remain, often driven by a lack of reliable data.\nMeasuring Sex, Gender Identity, and Sexual Orientation recommends that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) adopt new practices for collecting data on sex, gender, and sexual orientation  -  including collecting gender data by default, and not conflating gender with sex as a biological variable.  The report recommends standardized language to be used in survey questions that ask about a respondent's sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation.  Better measurements will improve data quality, as well as the NIH's ability to identify LGBTQI+ populations and understand the challenges they face.",

	abstract = {The biopsychosocial etiology of gender dysphoria is poorly understood, but current thought suggests a complex interaction of genetic, hormonal, environmental, and differences in brain development and physiology. Twin studies have implicated a genetic role in the formation of gender identity. Congruence for gender dysphoria is more common among monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins. We present a case of monozygotic (identical) triplets who have each transitioned from female to male under the care of a university transgender health service. Each triplet experienced gender dysphoria from childhood and has undergone transitional endocrine care and various aspects of gender-affirming surgery. Although a pure genetic or biological component cannot be attributed as a cause of their gender dysphoria with absolute certainty since the triplets were raised together, this unusual case of gender dysphoria among a set of monozygotic triplets adds support for a heritable role in gender identity formation.},

	abstract = {Gender constancy judgments in children referredfor problems in their gender identity development (N =206) and controls (N = 95) were compared. On Slaby andFrey's (1975) gender constancy interview, the gender-referred children performed more poorlythan the controls at three stage levels: genderidentity, gender stability, and gender consistency. Onthe Boy-Girl Identity Task, a second measure of gender constancy (Emmerich et al., 1977), thegender-referred children also performed more poorly.Gender-referred children who had not attained genderconsistency engaged in significantly less same-sex-typed play on a free-play task than thegender-referred children who had, but there were nogender consistency effects for the controls. Two othermeasures of sex-typed behavior were unrelated to genderconsistency. In the gender-referred group alone, childrenwho “failed” the gender identity or genderstability stages were more likely to draw anopposite-sex person first on the Draw-a-Person test andto evince more affective gender confusion on the GenderIdentity Interview (Zucker et al., 1993) than childrenwho had “passed.” It is concluded thatchildren referred for problems in their gender identitydevelopment have a developmental lag in gender constancyacquisition. Possible reasons for the lag arediscussed.},
